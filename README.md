# CREB3-ChIP-Seq-Analysis
This project describes a pipeline for analyzing ChIP-seq data using samtools, macs2, bedtools, and more to map ChIP-seq reads to a reference genome, filter out low-quality and multi-mapping reads, call peaks to identify protein-DNA interactions, and compare results between replicates and with external datasets like ENCODE for CREB3
